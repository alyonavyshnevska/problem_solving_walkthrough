## Incremental Development: Step-by-Step Problem Solving

## Walkthrough
The problem solving **walkthrough** is a written **guided description** of the journey from a problem to a solution. Detailed reasoning is performed and written for each one of the phases. For example, in the first phase, besides stating the problem in your own words you should include at least a few input-output pairs. As another example, a well-performed design phase contains several drafts showing gradual improvements. It should also justify your choice of datastructures.

**Incremental development** is the preferred way to apply the model. Get something working and keep it working. 


### Structure
Solving a problem may be messy sometimes and non-linear. Keep in mind that your goal is to guide the reader through solving the problem in a logical and clear manner, so you shouldn't record all the twists and turns you had. The walkthrough is a "better version of the truth". However if you encounter an interesting or teachable bug, you are encouraged to document how you solved the bug (hint: reproduce, diagnose, fix, reflect). In fact, you can get extra credit for that (read more in evaluation section)!
