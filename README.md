## Incremental Development: Step-by-Step Problem Solving

## Walkthrough
The problem solving **walkthrough** is a written **guided description** of the journey from a problem to a solution. Detailed reasoning is performed and written for each one of the phases. For example, in the first phase, besides stating the problem in own words I include a few input-output pairs. Also, a design phase contains several drafts showing gradual improvements. The choice of data structures is justified. 

**Incremental development** is the heart of this mini-project. The motto here is "Get something working and keep it working".
