    "## Walkthrough\n",
    "The problem solving **walkthrough** is a written **guided description** of the journey from a problem to a solution. Detailed reasoning is performed and written for each one of the phases. For example, in the first phase, besides stating the problem in your own words you should include at least a few input-output pairs. As another example, a well-performed design phase contains several drafts showing gradual improvements. It should also justify your choice of datastructures.\n",

    "    Only C is available, and so it is done first.  \n",
    "    Next, both A and F are available. A is first alphabetically, so it is done next.  \n",
    "    Then, even though F was available earlier, steps B and D are now also available, and B is the first alphabetically of the three.  \n",
    "    After that, only D and F are available. E is not available because only some of its prerequisites are complete. Therefore, D is completed next.  \n",
